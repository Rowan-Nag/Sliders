This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### "Sliders"

A grid based player vs player strategy game where each player moves tiles and gives them instructions, which are enacted on the next turn.
Originally meant to be an AI project, possibly using a genetic algorithm.

Every turn, players will first lay down grey tiles in which no sliders can be placed on or cross.
Next, the players will lay down their sliders and give them a direction to slide in
Finally, all the sliders on the board will slide, and players will be awarded points.
